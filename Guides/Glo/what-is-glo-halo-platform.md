# :sparkles: What is Glo & Halo Platform? :sparkles:

Simply put Halo Platform is a crypto currency management and interaction platform built on the Halo Platform Blockchain using the Halo Currency. Glo is the Go-Halo-Platform implimentation forked from go-ethereum to facilitate and run the blockchain for Halo Platform.



`Glo` is an Etherium-based distributed ledger protocol with transaction/contract privacy and new consensus mechanisms.

##  Key enhancements over go-ethereum

- :lock: `Privacy` - Glo supports private transactions and private contracts through public/private state separation and utilising Constellation, a peer-to-peer encrypted message exchange for directed transfer of private data to network participants
- :mag: `Alternative Consensus Mechanisms` - with no need for POW/POS in a permissioned network, Glo instead offers multiple consensus mechanisms that are more appropriate for consortium chains:
- :mag_right: `Raft-based Consensus` - a consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation
Istanbul BFT - a PBFT-inspired consensus algorithm with transaction finality, by AMIS.
- :busts_in_silhouette: `Peer Permissioning` - node/peer permissioning using smart contracts, ensuring only known parties can join the network
- :zap: `Higher Performance` - Glo offers significantly higher performance than public geth
