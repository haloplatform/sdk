# Halo Platform - SDK
Software Development Kit - Guides & Information for developing with Halo Platform

This repository will help developers find resources, and instruct where to look for documentation. All public wiki's, repo's, and tools will be listed out here and kept up to date. 

**Pull requests are welcomed.**

## Halo Platform Improvement Proposals

These are proposals that are submitted and discussed for implementation into the core coin or other halo platform projects. It is open for community involvement and discussion. [Please see it at the community that houses it here](https://community.haloplatform.tech/forum/11-improvement-proposals/).

## Rule of Thumb

If it works on Ethereum, most likely it just works on Halo Platform. So if you know how to build DAPPS or work with the Ethereum chain, then you can do so on Halo Platform with ease. It also helps that if you have questions or want to learn then you can use learning resources from Ethereum too.

##### Learning Resources

Like anything, working with the blockchain takes time to learn. We recommend javascript and web3.js. If you are a beginner in programming you should take time to learn nodejs and a frontend framework (we like [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)).

Frontend:

- [VueJS - Docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
- [VueJS - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

Backend: 

- [NodeJS - Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- [NodeJS - Nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/)
- [NodeJS - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/)

Interface with Halo Platform (Just like interfacing with Ethereum):

- [Web3JS - Docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/getting-started.html)

Write Smart Contracts:

- [Solidity - Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.5/)
- [Solidity - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/)
