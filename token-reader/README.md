# Token Reader

This is a simple nodejs script for interfacing with an ERC20 token. You can use the same basic logic in a javascript frontend DAPP as well.

Stubbed out are the following functions:

- `balanceOf` - gets balance of token for the given address
- `transfer` - transfers the given amount of tokens to a specific address
- `approve` - approves a given address for the amount of tokens to spend on your behalf

This is a brief script that is just an example. Use wisely. Uses web3 0.2x and not 1.x.
